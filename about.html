				<h2> About Me <hr /></h2>
				<p> Hello! My name is Ethan Little. I am 20 years old and from Greensboro, NC. I am 
					currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in 
					Mathematics. My favorite color is orange and I own six goldfish.
				</p>
				<p> What do I want to do with my life? Well, after taking a web development class 
					this semester, I have decided to pursue web development as I love the direct 
					connection it can have with the user. I believe web development, especially font-end, 
					can allow me to be more creative.
