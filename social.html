				<h1> Volunteer <hr /></h1>
				<p> Camp Carefree is a 6-week overnight summer camp for kids with chronic illnesses. Since my freshmen year of 
					high school, I have volunteered my summer at Camp Carefree. It truly is the greatest place on earth and is 
					very dear to my heart. While volunteering at Camp Carefree I have been a counselor, staff member, and supervisor. 
					Even though camp was canceled this past summer because of COVID, I am still very much involved with camp and the kids 
					with creating online videos for Camp Carefree's Facebook and Youtube channel.

				<p>I am a very outdoor type of person. So I really enjoy kayaking, hiking, tubing, snowboarding, camping, 
					mountain biking, and other activites. At the start of COVID during quarrentine I decided to learn
					video editing and photoshop to be able to show some of my adventures. I also needed to learn those tools
					to help Camp Carefree with their online videos and activities the summer of 2020. So below are some of 
					my videos from youtube.
