				<h1> Volunteer </h1>
				<p> Camp Carefree is a 6 week overnight summer camp for kids with chronic illnesses. Since freshmen 
					year of highschool I have volunteered my summer at Camp Carefree. It truly is the greatest
					place on earth and is very dear to my heart. Even though camp was cancelled this past summer because
					of COVID, I am still very much envolved with camp and the kids.

				<h1> Hobbies </h1>
				<p>I am a very outdoor type of person. So I really enjoy kayaking, hiking, tubing, snowboarding, camping, 
					mountain biking, and other activites. At the start of COVID during quarrentine I decided to learn
					video editing and photoshop to be able to show some of my adventures. I also needed to learn those tools
					to help Camp Carefree with their online videos and activities the summer of 2020. So below are some of 
					my videos from youtube.
