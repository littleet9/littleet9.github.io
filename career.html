					<h2>Camp Carefree Online Application Process (Fall 2020 - Spring 2021)</h2>
					<p> As an ECRS scholar, I am on a team with three other S-Stem scholar students. Every year we 
						are required to work on a project and present our results in the spring. As of fall 2020, 
						my team and I are creating a secure database and online application process so that Camp 
						Carefree counselors and campers can apply online, save time, money, and frustration that 
						comes with paper applications for the directors and nurses of Camp Carefree. (Camp Carefree 
						is a camp for kids with chronic illnesses. I go more in-depth on my social page.)</p>
					<p> My role on the team is a front-end developer. However,  since I am the only person who has 
						worked at Camp I have picked up a few additional roles. Such as becoming the leader of the 
						team, being in communication with the board members of CCF, and have been planning out and 
						designing the website and database so that it meets Camp's goals and needs. The link below
						will take you to our in progress CCF page.

					<h2>Unreal Engine Game Development (Fall 2019 - Spring 2020)</h2>
					<p> As a new ECRS scholar, I was placed on a team where we developed an Unreal Engine horror 
						game based in the model of the computer science building at App State. The horror game only
						lacked a story line, but had full mechanics, textures, sound, lighting, obsticles, and 
						an AI "monster".

				<h2>Appalachian State University Research Assistant (Summer 2020 - )</h2>
				<img id="SpineLeafDemo" src="media/SpineLeafDemo.gif"/>
				<p> Working under Dr. Hamza from the computer science department my partner and I have been using
					OMNeT++ and INet to build and test simulated data center network topologies and technologies. 
					We also have been researching new trends in free-space optical data center network topologies that
					provide reconfigurability, high fan-out, scalability, lower costs, lower heat, and lower hop-count 
					for intercommunication.</p>
				<p> To the right is one of our simulations that correctly implements a Spine Leaf Datacenter with 4 Spines
					and 6 Leafs with 3 servers each. Our simulation is scalable and can do larger networks.
